The architecture consists of the following major components:

- **Data Ingestion Layer**: Captures data from various sources using streaming and batch processes
- **Data Processing Layer**: Transforms and validates data using serverless and container-based processing
- **Data Storage Layer**: Stores raw, processed, and curated data in appropriate storage services
- **Analytics Layer**: Provides business intelligence and analytics capabilities
- **Monitoring Layer**: Ensures system health and performance

## AWS Services Mapping
