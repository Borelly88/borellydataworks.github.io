# AWS Service Mapping for Telemedicine Appointment Data Pipeline

This document provides a detailed mapping between the local components in our Telemedicine Appointment Data Pipeline and their AWS service equivalents. This mapping helps understand how the current implementation would translate to a production AWS environment.

## Data Sources

| Local Component | AWS Service | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|-------------|

| **Airflow** | **Amazon MWAA (Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow)** | Workflow orchestration would be handled by Amazon MWAA, which provides a fully managed Airflow service, eliminating the operational overhead of managing Airflow infrastructure. |
| **S3 Connector** | **AWS Glue Connectors** | Data connectors would be implemented using AWS Glue connectors, which provide pre-built integration with various data sources and targets. |
| **External API Connector** | **AWS Lambda + API Gateway** | API connectors would be implemented using Lambda functions triggered by API Gateway or on a schedule via EventBridge. |

## Data Processing

| Local Component | AWS Service | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|-------------|
| **ETL Scripts** | **AWS Glue** | ETL processes would be implemented using AWS Glue, which provides a serverless environment for data preparation and transformation with built-in support for various data formats. |
| **Data Quality Checks** | **AWS Glue Data Quality** | Data quality validation would be performed using AWS Glue Data Quality, which provides built-in rules and custom validation capabilities. |
| **Pipeline Orchestrator** | **AWS Step Functions** | Complex data processing workflows would be orchestrated using Step Functions, which provides visual workflow design and integration with various AWS services. |

## Data Warehouse

| Local Component | AWS Service | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|-------------|
| **SQLite Database** | **Amazon Redshift** | The data warehouse would be implemented using Amazon Redshift, which provides a fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse optimized for analytics workloads. |
| **Dimension Tables** | **Redshift Tables** | Dimension tables would be implemented as Redshift tables with appropriate distribution and sort keys for optimal query performance. |
| **Fact Tables** | **Redshift Tables** | Fact tables would be implemented as Redshift tables with appropriate distribution and sort keys, potentially using Redshift Spectrum for historical data stored in S3. |

## Visualization

| Local Component | AWS Service | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Custom Dashboards** | **Amazon QuickSight** | Dashboards would be implemented using Amazon QuickSight, which provides interactive dashboards with built-in ML insights and easy sharing capabilities. |
| **Matplotlib/Seaborn Charts** | **QuickSight Visuals** | Custom visualizations would be created using QuickSight's visual types, with the ability to create custom visuals when needed. |
| **HTML Reports** | **QuickSight Dashboards** | Interactive reports would be implemented as QuickSight dashboards with filtering, drill-down capabilities, and scheduled refresh. |

## Monitoring and Alerts

| Local Component | AWS Service | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Monitoring Scripts** | **Amazon CloudWatch** | System monitoring would be implemented using CloudWatch, which provides metrics, logs, and dashboards for AWS resources and custom applications. |
| **Alert System** | **CloudWatch Alarms + SNS** | Alerts would be implemented using CloudWatch Alarms to detect conditions and SNS to deliver notifications via email, SMS, or integration with other services. |
| **Monitoring Dashboard** | **CloudWatch Dashboards** | Operational dashboards would be implemented using CloudWatch Dashboards, which provide customizable views of metrics and alarms. |

## Infrastructure and Deployment

| Local Component | AWS Service | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Docker Containers** | **Amazon ECS/EKS** | Containerized applications would be deployed using ECS (Elastic Container Service) or EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) for container orchestration. |
| **Local Development** | **AWS Cloud9/CodeCatalyst** | Development environments would be managed using Cloud9 or CodeCatalyst, providing consistent, cloud-based development experiences. |
| **Manual Deployment** | **AWS CodePipeline + CodeBuild + CodeDeploy** | Deployment would be automated using CodePipeline for orchestration, CodeBuild for building and testing, and CodeDeploy for deployment automation. |

## Security and Compliance

| Local Component | AWS Service | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Basic Authentication** | **Amazon Cognito + IAM** | Authentication and authorization would be implemented using Cognito for user management and IAM for fine-grained access control. |
| **Local Encryption** | **AWS KMS + S3 Encryption** | Data encryption would be implemented using KMS for key management and native encryption capabilities of services like S3, RDS, and Redshift. |
| **Manual Auditing** | **AWS CloudTrail + Config** | Auditing and compliance would be implemented using CloudTrail for API activity logging and Config for resource configuration monitoring. |

## Cost Considerations

When migrating from the local implementation to AWS, consider the following cost factors:

1. **Data Transfer**: Costs for data transfer between AWS services and to/from the internet.
2. **Storage**: Costs for S3 storage, RDS and Redshift storage, and backup storage.
3. **Compute**: Costs for EC2 instances, Lambda executions, and managed service compute resources.
4. **Managed Services**: Costs for managed services like MSK, MWAA, and QuickSight.

To optimize costs:

1. **Right-sizing**: Choose appropriate instance types and sizes based on workload requirements.
2. **Reserved Instances/Savings Plans**: Use reserved instances or savings plans for predictable workloads.
3. **Lifecycle Policies**: Implement lifecycle policies for S3 data to move infrequently accessed data to cheaper storage classes.
4. **Auto-scaling**: Configure auto-scaling to match resources with demand.

## Implementation Approach

To migrate from the local implementation to AWS, we recommend a phased approach:

1. **Infrastructure Setup**: Deploy the core infrastructure using Terraform (see the provided templates).
2. **Data Migration**: Migrate existing data to the appropriate AWS services.
3. **Component Migration**: Migrate each component one by one, starting with less critical components.
4. **Testing**: Thoroughly test each migrated component before proceeding.
5. **Cutover**: Once all components are migrated and tested, perform the final cutover.

This mapping provides a clear path for migrating the Telemedicine Appointment Data Pipeline to AWS, leveraging managed services to reduce operational overhead while maintaining the functionality and insights provided by the current implementation.
